In other words, Government serves the needs of all people rather than just wealthy campaign contributors.&rdquo;<br><br>" +
        "This isn't radical or scary! Many of the programs instituted by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson that we take for granted today &mdash; such as Medicare, the 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, and Social Security &mdash; <a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/bernie-sanders-makes-his-pitch-for-socialism/416913/'>can be considered socialist programs</a>.<br><br>" +
